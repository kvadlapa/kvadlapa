### Message to the audience
Dear Audience,

Thank you for taking the time to explore my GitHub profile. I’m a first-generation graduate in my family, and studying abroad has been a dream of mine since childhood. Despite the challenges and difficult family circumstances, I’ve worked hard to make that dream a reality.

My journey has been driven by determination, curiosity, and a deep passion for learning. Every project I share here reflects not just my technical growth but also the resilience that brought me this far. I hope my work speaks for itself—and I’m excited to continue growing and contributing in meaningful ways. I consider myself a hard working individual who doesn’t give up easily. Whether it's learning a new technology, debugging a complex issue, or collaborating with a team, I give it my full effort. My journey so far reflects both my passion for software engineering and my commitment to personal and professional growth.

If you’re a hiring manager and find that I may not meet every single requirement, please know that I’m always open to putting in the effort to learn new technologies and tools. I enjoy stepping outside my comfort zone and believe that a willingness to learn is just as important as existing knowledge.

I’m graduating with a Master’s in Computer Science from Michigan Technological University on April 25, 2025. My F-1 OPT application has been approved, and my EAD start date is June 16, 2025.

I’m currently seeking full-time opportunities as a Software Engineer, with interests in backend development, full-stack Java development, or embedded software roles.

Please feel free to share any suggestions, offer support, or help me connect with the right individuals in the industry. I truly appreciate any guidance or referrals as I take this next step in my career journey.

Thank you!
Kiran
